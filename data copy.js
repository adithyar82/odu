She had that unique ability to make you feel better about yourself. You liked who you were when you were with her. You missed her when she wasnt around.                                            Her husband Joe posted an entry on face book for her birthday, October 23. When I read it I didnt think that I could do better at describing how Michele affected everyone who came in contact with her and how she approached life. With his permission I                        am going to share some of what was posted.  When confronted with metastatic breast cancer she persevered, choosing to go out on her terms and leaving it all on the field. Rather than be weighed down by sadness, anger, or self-pity, her thoughts and actions remained selfless                        and positive. She was far less concerned about herself than of how her illness and premature passing would impact everyone else.  Not one to brag Michele rarely talked the talk although she most definitely walked the walk in every facet of her life. The Four Foot Surgeon raised the bar higher than many of us can reach, but that doesnt mean we should not                        aspire to do the same. Her compassion, love, ingenuity, strength, humility and humor will forever be a part of each of us. Akin to how she met everyone with a smile and how she always demurred any deference by refusing to drop the doctor card (or for that matter, the cancer card) to garner any sort of accommodation, I challenge us all to live by Micheles                        ideals and example. Joe went on to implore us to not mourn for the loss of Michele but to celebrate her life. Enjoy music, laughter, food and good friends. For those of us who know Michele well, she had eclectic taste in music,                        an impeccable sense of humor, gourmet sensibilities, and anybody who knew her could call her friend.                         Please, on October 23 and every day, make it count. Be sure to lend a hand to someone in need, give to a favorite charity, share your favorite Michele-related story and celebrate who she was, all that she did, and all that she continues to represent.                        To my very good friend Michele - I miss you every day and without your help this manual would not exist.                        ~ Dr. Ann Kuhn                    "}, {"id": "IntroTraumaProgram", "body": "Introduction and Trauma Program Mission                        The CHKD trauma program serves the children of Hampton Roads, Virginias Eastern Shore and Northeastern North Carolina. As a specialized pediatric medical center, CHKD provides a multi- disciplinary approach to care for injured children for all ranges                        of acuity and injuries. The commitment to provide care to traumatically injured children and their families extends from the frontline providers to the board of directors. CHKD is currently seeking trauma center verification from                        the Virginia Department of Health which will allow for pediatric specialists from ED, surgery, ICU and all subspecialties to care for patients directly from the field. The trauma service is staffed by board-certified pediatric                        surgeons and their support team of physician assistants, nurse practitioners, residents, interns and office staff.                                            The trauma program is led by a board-certified pediatric surgeon who completed a fellowship in trauma. The program is co-managed by a pediatric emergency physician and employs a full-time RN trauma program manager, RN trauma registrar and RN clinical                        practice educator specialist.                     The program director chairs the hospital multi-disciplinary trauma PI committee which includes representatives from all the major surgical specialties and services including administration and nursing. The trauma PI committee provides                        oversight for systems, patient care, quality, policies and procedures to ensure the optimum care of any injured patient is achieved.                                            Trauma is a surgical disease that requires the need for multiple specialty services which CHKD is uniquely qualified to provide. The purpose of this manual is to document established guidelines that ensure an organized and systematic approach to care.

Penetrating Neck Trauma                                                            The goal of this management guideline is to encourage timely exploration in symptomatic patients and to obtain appropriate diagnostic studies in asymptomatic patients. The critical maneuver in the management of these patients is the physical examination,                                as all decisions are made based on physical findings. There are several principles to bear in mind:                                                                1.

Attending notification is required for SW to the neck.                                                                    3. Penetrating neck wounds should not be probed.                                                                    4. An adequate surgical exploration involves visualizing the wound tract, exploring the carotid sheath, and fully mobilizing the trachea and esophagus if there are signs of aerodigestive injury or if the trajectory of the wound is in proximity of these                                    structures.

Entry and exit wounds on opposite side of the thorax                                                                    2. Single entry wound with X-ray demonstrating a missile on opposite side of the thoracic cavity or in close proximity to the mediastinum                                                                    3. Multiple gunshot wounds to thorax                                                                There is little controversy regarding the management of unstable patients - they should have emergent thorocotomy. However, stable patients could harbor occult injuries to critical mediastinal structures (heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus). Consequently,                                patients have routinely been submitted to a battery of invasive diagnostic tests: echocardiography or subxiphoid pericardial window, arch aortography, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy and or esophagography. The latter two have                                been employed together in order to improve upon the sensitivity of each individual test. This array of tests can be expensive and time consuming, as only a small percentage of hemodynamically stable, asymptomatic patients                                have clinically significant injuries.                                                            Helical CT of the chest has proven useful in demonstrating the trajectory of missiles in the thorax. In the setting of a potential TMGSW, a CT scan may confirm a trajectory remote from the mediastinum, obviating further testing. On the other hand, proven                                transmediastinal trajectory mandates further evaluation. However, rather than performing all of the aforementioned tests, the investigations may be tailored to the specific clinical scenario.                                                            Trajectory near the pericardium warrants echocardiography or pericardial window. If CT suggests aortic injury, or if the trajectory is superior to the arch, arteriography remains the gold standard (TEE cannot be considered reliable enough). Bronchoscopy                                is indicated for pneumomediastinum, respiratory distress or bronchopleural fistula  massive air leak. Esophagoscopy has been reported to have 100% sensitivity for thoracic esophageal injuries. In an awake, asymptomatic                                patient, barium esophagography is easier to obtain and may be adequate by itself. The cervical esophagus most difficult to reliably evaluate, and so both studies are warranted.                            Truncal Stab Wounds                                 The purpose of this algorithm is to guide the management of patients with stab wounds to the anterior abdomen, thoracoabdominal area back and flank.                            Back Flank stab wounds are defined as those between the tips of the scapulae and posterior iliac crests, posterior to the mid-axillary line. Physical examination alone is unreliable in this group, and DPL is unable                                to evaluate the retroperitoneum. Triple contrast (oral, rectal, and intravenous) CT has a sensitivity of 89-100% and a specificity of 98-100% in diagnosing intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal injuries.                            Thoracoabdominal stab wounds are defined as those between a circumferential line connecting the nipples and tips of the scapulae superiorly, and the costal margins inferiorly. Occult diaphragmatic injury is problematic                                in this patient group. Radiological evaluation (US  CT MRI) may miss small tears, so laparoscopy thoracoscopy remains investigation of choice if suspicion is high.                            Anterior abdominal stab wounds are defined as those anterior to the mid-axillary line, from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis. Although optimal management of stable patients with AASW is debated, we have                                adopted a protocol of serial clinical assessments to determine the need for laparotomy.                                                            Stab wounds may fall into more than one defined region, thus a combined work-up may be required. For these type of wounds, or in the setting of multiple stab wounds, exploration may be indicated.

Deceleration forces (e.g., high speed MVCs, falls from heights) cause tearing of the aorta at points of fixation: ligamentum arteriosum (80-85%),                            diaphragmatic hiatus (10-15%), and ascending aorta ( 5-10% ). 85% of fatalities occur at the accident scene. Of the remainder, 25% occur within 24 hours and another 25% within one week. The A-P CXR is a reasonable screening test for BAI. Findings suggestive of BAI (including widened mediastinum, indistinct aortic knob, depression of left main stem bronchus, deviation of NG tube, opacification of aortopulmonary                            window, widening of paratracheal  paraspinous stripes, apical capping, scapular fracture or 1st 2nd rib fracture) should prompt chest CT. If suspicion of BAI is low, a widened mediastinum may be further investigated by upright                            CXR. However, if suspicion of BAI is high, as in situations where there has been a severe deceleration mechanism, chest CT is indicated regardless of CXR findings as the initial CXR may be interpreted as normal in up to 7%                            of patients with BAI. Helical chest CT is a sensitive test for BAI, and its specificity approaches 100%. Suspicious findings warrant arteriography (the gold standard). If CT is diagnostic of BAI, the decision to proceed to                            aortography vs. thoracotomy is the thoracic surgeons preference. Once BAI is diagnosed or strongly suspected , antihypertensive therapy should be instituted to prevent aortic rupture. Esmolol is preferred initially. A loading dose of 0.5ug kg over 30 sec is followed by infusion of 50 ug kg min                            (increasing up to 300 ug kg min as needed.) If necessary, nitroprusside (2-5 ug kg min) may be added.Multisystem injuries (90%) and brain injuries (50%) are commonly associated with BAI, and management must be prioritize. Use of beta blockers may not be an acceptable option in patients with closed head injuries as decreasing systematic                            arterial pressure would impact cerebral perfusion pressures. Severe brain injury, blunt cardiac injury, or pulmonary injury may be prohibitive risks to early repair. Nonoperative management (i.e. antihypertensive and other                            supportive therapy) should be considered, with potential delayed repair."}, {"id": "topic6_3", "body": "Blunt Cardiac Injury (BCI)Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is a common cause of scene death.The goal of this algorithm is not to identify all patients with a BCI; the diagnosis itself is of secondary importance. Rather, the goal is to identify the patients at risk for complications (dysrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, or structural                        injury) which may require treatment. BCI should be suspected in individuals who sustain major chest trauma. The initial evaluation should include an ECG as part of the secondary survey. Patients with shock from any cause, ischemic changes on ECG or significant dysrhythmia are admitted to the ICU.

The following situations should prompt the activation of the MTP (Appendix 2):                                                                        Life-threatening trauma presenting to the Emergency Department                                                                            Life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to the Emergency Department                                                                            Unexpected surgical blood loss                                                                            Surgeries expected to require massive transfusion                                                                            Patients who require transfusion of at least one total blood volume within a 24-hour period                                                                    The Attending Physician or Resident Designee will determine which patients based on physiology or injury warrant activation of the MTP. A member of the Patient Care Team will call Transfusion Service to activate the MTP                                                            Upon notifying Transfusion Service, the appropriate massive transfusion bundle [packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and single donor apheresis platelets (SDP)] will be prepared according to the patients weight.                                                            The MTP will remain in effect until the Attending Physician or Resident Designee discontinues the order                                                    Patient Identification                                                    Strict compliance with product patient identification procedures is mandatory, regardless of time pressures.                                                            All patients MUST be identified by two independent and unique identifiers. The unique identifiers MUST be physically attached to the patient before specimen collection no matter how extreme the patients clinical state.                                                            In the event that a trauma patient cannot be positively identified, the trauma identification system will be used.                                                    Ongoing Communication                                                    The Attending Physician will designate one member of the healthcare team to be the communicator with personnel from the Transfusion Service.                                                            The communicator should be able to provide the following information:                                                                        Responsible physician surgeon                                                                            Patient location                                                                            Patients medical record number or trauma ID number, patients name (this may be a trauma ID number, gender, date of birth if known                                                                            Patients weight (may be estimated using the Broselow tape)                                                                    In order to best fulfill ongoing changing patient needs, Transfusion Service must be informed regularly of the status of the patient at a minimum every 30 minutes until ongoing transfusion is no longer necessary                                                            The attending physician or a member of the patient care team must inform Transfusion Service of any change in patient needs, any change in patient location, and in the case of a trauma patient, the end of a trauma code.                                                            The Director of the Transfusion Service will be notified of any special needs.                                                    Determination of the Patients Blood Type                                                    The Patient Care Team must make every effort to obtain a properly identified and labeled blood specimen for blood type and crossmatch before transfusion. The patient must be identified with a blood bracelet and the tube labeled with a blood bank number.                                                                        The Patient Care Team must inform the Transfusion Service if the blood sample for type and crossmatch was obtained after transfusion                                                                            Historical ABO groups are not acceptable for unit selection                                                                            Type specific uncrossmatched blood can only be issued if the patient has a completed type and screen by the CHKD Transfusion Service at the time of the emergency.                                                                    Properly identified recipients whose ABO group has been determined by our facility within 3 days of emergency issue may receive type specific uncrossmatched blood.                                                            It is not acceptable to take a verbal blood type from medical staff or from personnel transporting the patient from an outside facility.                                                            Patients who receive an unknown designation will not have their identification corrected to their actual identifiers for at least 24 hours in order to avoid confusion with specimen processing.                                                                        Once a patients identifiers are changed from Unknown to actual, a new sample MUST be obtained for blood type and antibody screen if the need for future blood products is anticipated.                                                                    When transfusion support is necessary before completion of the type and screen and crossmatch, group O negative red cells and group AB plasma and platelets will be issued.                                                            When blood products are transfused before a type and crossmatch are completed the Transfusion Service must be notified that the patient was transfused prior to collecting the specimen.                                                    Blood Products Transported from Outside Institutions                                                    It is never acceptable to use blood products based on historic blood type                                                            Untransfused blood products transported with a patient from an outside hospital MUST be removed and delivered immediately to the Transfusion Service.                                                            The exception to this is untransfused blood products transported with a patient from Sentara Norfolk General Hospital may continue to be infused.                                                    Laboratory Monitoring during Activation of MTP                                                    If the patient has a type and screen ordered as part of an initial trauma evaluation it does not need to be re-ordered upon activation of the MTP                                                    Recommendations for types of Blood Products                                                    Transfusion of products can be based on the results of lab tests and or established ratios of plasma-to-RBC and platelet-to-RBC.                                                            Every effort will be made to provide Rh-negative products to Rhnegative recipients.                                                    Blood Warming                                                    All patients undergoing massive transfusion must receive IVF, red blood cells and plasma through a rapid fluid warmer.                                                            Do NOT use the rapid fluid warmer if transfusing platelets, cryoprecipitate or granulocyte as these products can be rendered less effective.                                                    Intraoperative Blood Recovery                     Whenever possible, perioperative autologous cell salvage should be considered                                                Transfusion Reactions                     Any suspected transfusion reaction must be reported immediately to Transfusion Service in order to safely fulfill ongoing transfusion needs                                                Consent for Blood Transfusion                                                    Informed consent for blood transfusion must be documented in the medical record.                                                            Transfusion should not be delayed in life-threatening situations                                                                        In the event of a medical emergency of a minor and the parent or legal guardian is unable to be contacted to provide informed consent, the Attending Physician may proceed with treatment to the extent that is necessary to alleviate the emergency                                                                            The physician must document the circumstances of the medical emergency in the medical record.                                                            Complications of Massive Transfusion                     In addition to usual transfusion risks, there are risks that are unique to massive transfusion which include the following: hypothermia, acid-base disturbances, citrate toxicity, electrolyte disorders, thrombocytopenia, depletion                        of coagulation factors.

The Transfusion Service                            will automatically prepare an initial MTGP as soon as possible after the MTP is activated. Subsequent MTGPs will be prepared as needed.

Appendix 5 - Complications of Massive Transfusion                                                        Hypothermia                                                                Blood transfusion can exacerbate the hypothermia already present in patients with major trauma. Hypothermia can impair hemostasis, delay metabolism of citrate, lactate and drugs, increase hemoglobin oxygen affinity, and reduce myocardial function.                                                                            Treatment and prevention of hypothermia should be accomplished by the use of active warming.                                                            Acid-base disturbances                                                            Stored blood contains lactate which results in a small but significant reduction in pH.                                                                            Citric acid is also present in stored blood. Each molecule of citrate is metabolized to three molecules of bicarbonate which can lead to metabolic alkalosis.                                                                            The patients overall condition and tissue hypoperfusion may lead to metabolic acidosis.                                                                            If acidosis is present in a patient receiving massive transfusion, it is much more likely to be the result of hypovolemia hypoperfusion than due to the effects of transfusion.                                                            Citrate toxicity                                                            Blood components are anticoagulated with sodium citrate.                                                                            Citrate binds divalent cations including calcium and magnesium.                                                                            Hypocalcemia may manifest clinically by reduced ventricular function, increased neuromuscular excitability and arrhythmia.                                                                            Hypomagnesemia can result in neuromuscular excitability and ventricular arrhythmia.                                                                            Calcium therapy during massive transfusion is typically necessary in neonates and patients with hepatic dysfunction. Ionized calcium levels can be used to guide therapy.                                                                            During massive transfusion, the bodys ability to metabolize and excrete citrate may be exceeded especially in patients with hypotension, hypothermia, hepatic injury or hepatic disease.                                                            Electrolyte disorders                                                            Hyperkalemia resulting from MT of older units of RBCs with an elevated amount of extracellular potassium can cause significant cardiac complications in some patients. Those at greatest risk are neonates and those in renal failure.                                                                            Hyperkalemia can be recognized by measuring serum potassium and observing ECG changes (peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, and ventricular arrhythmia).                                                                            Hyperkalemia can be avoided in neonates by using fresh units, less than 7 days old.                                                                            Hypokalemia can be seen in MT due to the metabolism of citrate to bicarbonate causing metabolic alkalosis. This is more often seen when large plasma rather than RBC units are transfused.                                                            Thrombocytopenia                                                            Dilutional thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count less than 50,000 uL in the setting of MT.                                                                            Platelets should be transfused if there is evidence of microvascular bleeding.                                                                            Platelet counts should be monitored at regular intervals and platelet transfusions given to maintain counts greater than 80,000 uL.                                                            Depletion of coagulation factors                                                            Impaired hemostasis is a frequent finding in trauma patients and may be caused by hypothermia, dilution of platelets and coagulation factors, and DIC.                                                                            RBC units have little plasma and are NOT a significant source of coagulation factors.                                                                            With exchange of one blood volume, approximately 37% of clotting factors remain within the circulation. After a controlled exchange of two blood volumes, intravascular clotting factors decrease to levels of approximately 13%.                                                                            FFP infusion is recommended when PT and APTT exceed 1.5 times mean control values. FFP should not be used as a volume expander.                                                                            Cryoprecipitate infusion is recommended when fibrinogen levels remain below 100mg dl despite plasma infusion.                                                            Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI)                                                            TRALI manifests as dyspnea, hypotension, bilateral pulmonary edema, and fever and resembles ARDS clinically.                                                                            Treatment is supportive and includes ventilator and hemodynamic assistance.                                                                            Additional blood components should be given if clear transfusion needs exist.                                                            Alloimmunization                                                            Transfusion recipients can form antibodies to HLA Class I and II antigens on platelets, leukocytes, to granulocytes, to platelet-specific antigens and to RBC specific antigens.                                                                            Consequences of alloimmunization include acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, febrile nonhemolytic reactions and a refractory response to platelet transfusion.

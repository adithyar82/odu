She had that unique ability to make you feel better about yourself. You liked who you were when you were with her. You missed her when she wasnt around.                                            Her husband Joe posted an entry on face book for her birthday, October 23. When I read it I didnt think that I could do better at describing how Michele affected everyone who came in contact with her and how she approached life. With his permission I                        am going to share some of what was posted.  When confronted with metastatic breast cancer she persevered, choosing to go out on her terms and leaving it all on the field. Rather than be weighed down by sadness, anger, or self-pity, her thoughts and actions remained selfless                        and positive. She was far less concerned about herself than of how her illness and premature passing would impact everyone else.  Not one to brag Michele rarely talked the talk although she most definitely walked the walk in every facet of her life. The Four Foot Surgeon raised the bar higher than many of us can reach, but that doesnt mean we should not                        aspire to do the same. Her compassion, love, ingenuity, strength, humility and humor will forever be a part of each of us. Akin to how she met everyone with a smile and how she always demurred any deference by refusing to drop the doctor card (or for that matter, the cancer card) to garner any sort of accommodation, I challenge us all to live by Micheles                        ideals and example. Joe went on to implore us to not mourn for the loss of Michele but to celebrate her life. Enjoy music, laughter, food and good friends. For those of us who know Michele well, she had eclectic taste in music,                        an impeccable sense of humor, gourmet sensibilities, and anybody who knew her could call her friend.                         Please, on October 23 and every day, make it count. Be sure to lend a hand to someone in need, give to a favorite charity, share your favorite Michele-related story and celebrate who she was, all that she did, and all that she continues to represent.                        To my very good friend Michele - I miss you every day and without your help this manual would not exist.                        ~ Dr. Ann Kuhn                    "}, {"id": "IntroTraumaProgram","metadata":"anusha", "body": "Introduction and Trauma Program Mission                        The CHKD trauma program serves the children of Hampton Roads, Virginias Eastern Shore and Northeastern North Carolina. As a specialized pediatric medical center, CHKD provides a multi- disciplinary approach to care for injured children for all ranges                        of acuity and injuries. The commitment to provide care to traumatically injured children and their families extends from the frontline providers to the board of directors. CHKD is currently seeking trauma center verification from                        the Virginia Department of Health which will allow for pediatric specialists from ED, surgery, ICU and all subspecialties to care for patients directly from the field. The trauma service is staffed by board-certified pediatric                        surgeons and their support team of physician assistants, nurse practitioners, residents, interns and office staff.                                            The trauma program is led by a board-certified pediatric surgeon who completed a fellowship in trauma. The program is co-managed by a pediatric emergency physician and employs a full-time RN trauma program manager, RN trauma registrar and RN clinical                        practice educator specialist.                     The program director chairs the hospital multi-disciplinary trauma PI committee which includes representatives from all the major surgical specialties and services including administration and nursing. The trauma PI committee provides                        oversight for systems, patient care, quality, policies and procedures to ensure the optimum care of any injured patient is achieved.                                            Trauma is a surgical disease that requires the need for multiple specialty services which CHKD is uniquely qualified to provide. The purpose of this manual is to document established guidelines that ensure an organized and systematic approach to care.

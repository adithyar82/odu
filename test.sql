The most sensitive test for post-traumatic tamponade is (subxiphoid) pericardial window. This requires general anesthesia in the operating room. In patients who do not require general anesthesia for surgery following penetrating trauma, the best non-invasive test for cardiac or pericardial injury is two dimensional echocardiography. This test is both sensitive and specific in the patients without hemothorax (100%/89%), yet is less accurate in the setting of hemothorax (56%/93%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Penetrating cardiac injuries can occur without entrance or exit wounds in the &quot;box&quot; - injuries to the heart can occur from a transmediastinal gunshot wound. A small retrospective study on gunshot wounds reveal that 40% of these patients present in extremis with decreased blood pressure and require emergency operation, with 1/3 of these patients having cardiac injury.

Entry and exit wounds on opposite side of the thorax</li>\r\n	<li>2. Single entry wound with X-ray demonstrating a missile on opposite side of the thoracic cavity or in close proximity to the mediastinum</li>\r\n	<li>3. Multiple gunshot wounds to thorax</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There is little controversy regarding the management of unstable patients - they should have emergent thorocotomy. However, stable patients could harbor occult injuries to critical mediastinal structures (heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus). Consequently, patients have routinely been submitted to a battery of invasive diagnostic tests: echocardiography or subxiphoid pericardial window, arch aortography, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy and/or esophagography. The latter two have been employed together in order to improve upon the sensitivity of each individual test. This array of tests can be expensive and time consuming, as only a small percentage of hemodynamically stable, asymptomatic patients have clinically significant injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helical CT of the chest has proven useful in demonstrating the trajectory of missiles in the thorax. In the setting of a potential TMGSW, a CT scan may confirm a trajectory remote from the mediastinum, obviating further testing. On the other hand, proven transmediastinal trajectory mandates further evaluation. However, rather than performing all of the aforementioned tests, the investigations may be tailored to the specific clinical scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trajectory near the pericardium warrants echocardiography or pericardial window. If CT suggests aortic injury, or if the trajectory is superior to the arch, arteriography remains the gold standard (TEE cannot be considered reliable enough). Bronchoscopy is indicated for pneumomediastinum, respiratory distress or bronchopleural fistula/ massive air leak. Esophagoscopy has been reported to have 100% sensitivity for thoracic esophageal injuries. In an awake, asymptomatic patient, barium esophagography is easier to obtain and may be adequate by itself. The cervical esophagus most difficult to reliably evaluate, and so both studies are warranted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Truncal Stab Wounds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of this algorithm is to guide the management of patients with stab wounds to the anterior abdomen, thoracoabdominal area back and flank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Back/Flank stab wounds</strong> are defined as those between the tips of the scapulae and posterior iliac crests, posterior to the mid-axillary line. Physical examination alone is unreliable in this group, and DPL is unable to evaluate the retroperitoneum. Triple contrast (oral, rectal, and intravenous) CT has a sensitivity of 89-100% and a specificity of 98-100% in diagnosing intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thoracoabdominal stab wounds</strong> are defined as those between a circumferential line connecting the nipples and tips of the scapulae superiorly, and the costal margins inferiorly. Occult diaphragmatic injury is problematic in this patient group. Radiological evaluation (US/ CT/MRI) may miss small tears, so laparoscopy/thoracoscopy remains investigation of choice if suspicion is high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anterior abdominal stab wounds</strong> are defined as those anterior to the mid-axillary line, from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis. Although optimal management of stable patients with AASW is debated, we have adopted a protocol of serial clinical assessments to determine the need for laparotomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stab wounds may fall into more than one defined region, thus a combined work-up may be required. For these type of wounds, or in the setting of multiple stab wounds, exploration may be indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Abdominal Stab Wound</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"burns chart\" src=\"./images/trauma_4.png\" style=\"height:800px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n');

Deceleration forces (e.g., high speed MVCs, falls\r\n                            from heights) cause tearing of the aorta at points of fixation: ligamentum\r\n                            arteriosum (80-85%), diaphragmatic hiatus (10-15%), and ascending\r\n                            aorta ( 5-10% ). 85% of fatalities occur at the accident scene. Of the\r\n                            remainder, 25% occur within 24 hours and another 25% within one week. </p>\r\n                        <p>The A-P CXR is a reasonable screening test for BAI. Findings suggestive of\r\n                            BAI (including widened mediastinum, indistinct aortic knob, depression\r\n                            of left main stem bronchus, deviation of NG tube, opacification of\r\n                            aortopulmonary window, widening of paratracheal/ paraspinous stripes,\r\n                            apical capping, scapular fracture or 1st/2nd rib fracture) should prompt\r\n                            chest CT. If suspicion of BAI is low, a widened mediastinum may be\r\n                            further investigated by upright CXR. However, if suspicion of BAI is high,\r\n                            as in situations where there has been a severe deceleration mechanism,\r\n                            chest CT is indicated regardless of CXR findings as the initial CXR may be\r\n                            interpreted as \"normal\" in up to 7% of patients with BAI. Helical chest CT\r\n                            is a sensitive test for BAI, and its specificity approaches 100%.

Entry and exit wounds on opposite side of the thorax</li>\r\n	<li>2. Single entry wound with X-ray demonstrating a missile on opposite side of the thoracic cavity or in close proximity to the mediastinum</li>\r\n	<li>3. Multiple gunshot wounds to thorax</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There is little controversy regarding the management of unstable patients - they should have emergent thorocotomy. However, stable patients could harbor occult injuries to critical mediastinal structures (heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus). Consequently, patients have routinely been submitted to a battery of invasive diagnostic tests: echocardiography or subxiphoid pericardial window, arch aortography, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy and/or esophagography. The latter two have been employed together in order to improve upon the sensitivity of each individual test. This array of tests can be expensive and time consuming, as only a small percentage of hemodynamically stable, asymptomatic patients have clinically significant injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helical CT of the chest has proven useful in demonstrating the trajectory of missiles in the thorax. In the setting of a potential TMGSW, a CT scan may confirm a trajectory remote from the mediastinum, obviating further testing. On the other hand, proven transmediastinal trajectory mandates further evaluation. However, rather than performing all of the aforementioned tests, the investigations may be tailored to the specific clinical scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trajectory near the pericardium warrants echocardiography or pericardial window. If CT suggests aortic injury, or if the trajectory is superior to the arch, arteriography remains the gold standard (TEE cannot be considered reliable enough). Bronchoscopy is indicated for pneumomediastinum, respiratory distress or bronchopleural fistula/ massive air leak. Esophagoscopy has been reported to have 100% sensitivity for thoracic esophageal injuries. In an awake, asymptomatic patient, barium esophagography is easier to obtain and may be adequate by itself. The cervical esophagus most difficult to reliably evaluate, and so both studies are warranted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Truncal Stab Wounds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of this algorithm is to guide the management of patients with stab wounds to the anterior abdomen, thoracoabdominal area back and flank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Back/Flank stab wounds</strong> are defined as those between the tips of the scapulae and posterior iliac crests, posterior to the mid-axillary line. Physical examination alone is unreliable in this group, and DPL is unable to evaluate the retroperitoneum. Triple contrast (oral, rectal, and intravenous) CT has a sensitivity of 89-100% and a specificity of 98-100% in diagnosing intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thoracoabdominal stab wounds</strong> are defined as those between a circumferential line connecting the nipples and tips of the scapulae superiorly, and the costal margins inferiorly. Occult diaphragmatic injury is problematic in this patient group. Radiological evaluation (US/ CT/MRI) may miss small tears, so laparoscopy/thoracoscopy remains investigation of choice if suspicion is high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anterior abdominal stab wounds</strong> are defined as those anterior to the mid-axillary line, from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis. Although optimal management of stable patients with AASW is debated, we have adopted a protocol of serial clinical assessments to determine the need for laparotomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stab wounds may fall into more than one defined region, thus a combined work-up may be required. For these type of wounds, or in the setting of multiple stab wounds, exploration may be indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Abdominal Stab Wound</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"burns chart\" src=\"./images/trauma_4.png\" style=\"height:800px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n'),

The cervical esophagus most difficult to reliably evaluate, and so both studies are warranted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Truncal Stab Wounds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of this algorithm is to guide the management of patients with stab wounds to the anterior abdomen, thoracoabdominal area back and flank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Back/Flank stab wounds</strong> are defined as those between the tips of the scapulae and posterior iliac crests, posterior to the mid-axillary line. Physical examination alone is unreliable in this group, and DPL is unable to evaluate the retroperitoneum. Triple contrast (oral, rectal, and intravenous) CT has a sensitivity of 89-100% and a specificity of 98-100% in diagnosing intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thoracoabdominal stab wounds</strong> are defined as those between a circumferential line connecting the nipples and tips of the scapulae superiorly, and the costal margins inferiorly. Occult diaphragmatic injury is problematic in this patient group. Radiological evaluation (US/ CT/MRI) may miss small tears, so laparoscopy/thoracoscopy remains investigation of choice if suspicion is high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anterior abdominal stab wounds</strong> are defined as those anterior to the mid-axillary line, from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis. Although optimal management of stable patients with AASW is debated, we have adopted a protocol of serial clinical assessments to determine the need for laparotomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stab wounds may fall into more than one defined region, thus a combined work-up may be required. For these type of wounds, or in the setting of multiple stab wounds, exploration may be indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Abdominal Stab Wound</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"burns chart\" src=\"./images/trauma_4.png\" style=\"height:800px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n');

However, if suspicion of BAI is high, as in situations where there has been a severe deceleration mechanism, chest CT is indicated regardless of CXR findings as the initial CXR may be interpreted as \"normal\" in up to 7% of patients with BAI. Helical chest CT is a sensitive test for BAI, and its specificity approaches 100%. Suspicious findings warrant arteriography (the gold standard).
